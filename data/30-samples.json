(KARL NORMAN ALONZO / PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n\nThe President voiced confidence about the chances of defeat of the rebels in a military encounter after mentioning the death of Jevilyn Cullamat in his televised address Monday night.\n\n\"O kita mo 'yung kay Cullamat. O 'di anak niya mismo, babae pa. Ah sigurado patay 'yan. Babae ilaban mo sa sundalo? Ah patay sigurado. (Look at what happened to Cullamat. Her own daughter was involved, a woman. Why let a woman fight a soldier? She will certainly die),\" he said in his remarks.\n\nDuterte had earlier identified the Makabayan bloc as among the legal fronts of the communist rebel group, saying they were part of an alleged grand conspiracy to bring down the government.\n\nBut the President told the rebels dreaming of \"utopia\" that this was not possible.\n\n\"You dream of a country, gusto ninyo ano, 'yung utopia (you want utopia). It's not possible here. You have to realize that,\" he said.\n\n\"Walang red-tagging-red tagging. Talagang komunista kayo, talagang kasama kayo (You are really communists, you are part of the group). Time will come,\" he added.\n\nJevilyn, the 22-year-old daughter of Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Eufemia Cullamat, was killed in a clash between the military and New People's Army (NPA) rebels in Surigao del Sur on Nov. 28. She reportedly served as a medic of the rebels.\n\nThe military released a photo showing the deceased rebel alongside seized weapons, triggering an uproar from her family. Cullamat admitted that her daughter joined the NPA to fight the injustices against the indigenous peoples but asked the military not to use her remains as a trophy.\n\nIn his speech, the President warned about the possible extinction of the Lumads if these indigenous peoples will support the communist movement before he addressed the killing of Jevilyn.\n\nHe told the Lumads to return to their homes, saying they were only being deceived by the NPA rebels.\n\n\"I think 75 percent, at least in Mindanao, mga Lumad. Kayong mga Lumad, umuwi kayo. Sabihin ninyo sa mga tao ninyo na niloloko lang sila ng --- niloloko ng ano, ng NPA talaga. Totoo 'yan. Ang maraming namatay ang Lumad (I think 75 percent, at least in Mindanao, are Lumads. You Lumads go home. Tell your people they are being fooled by the NPA. That's the truth. Many Lumads have died),\" he said.\n\n\"So if this thing goes on, the Lumads, 'yung native na Pilipino talaga, it will become an extinct tribe. 'Pag hindi kayo --- 'pag hindi kayo huminto diyan, lumayas, forever kayong wanted. Eh sabi nga ni Parlade sa Armed Forces, delikado kayong mamatay kayo sama-sama kayo diyan (If this thing goes on, the Lumads, the really native Filipinos, it will become an extinct tribe. If you don't stop, if you don't leave, you will be wanted by authorities forever. Like what Parlade of the Armed Forces said, it's dangerous. You might die if you join the rebels),\" he said.\n\nPrior to his remarks about Jevilyn, the President alleged that the Makabayan, Bayan, and Gabriela are among the front organizations of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army.\n\nThe Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives is composed of six party-list lawmakers from Bayan Muna, ACT Teachers, Gabriela Women's Party, and Kabataan.\n\n\"We are not tagging you. We are identifying you as communist. It's a grand conspiracy. So the liability of a mere soldier, is the liability of all the members of the organizations, iyong mga front (those are the front organizations),\" Duterte said.\n\nA visibly annoyed President also singled out Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Carlos Zarate in his latest rebuke, calling him a communist. \"You are friends with the NPA, you are co-conspirators. Komunista ka, adre, matagal na alam ko (You are a communist. I've known it for a long time),\" he said.\n\nCAPTION(S):</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-08T13:38:31Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43742692632&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=nWqydb5W8n3o_CuI5McaDA</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>696</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved\nCopyright 2020 Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp.</copyright>\n\t\t\t<loginStatus/>\n\t\t\t<duplicateGroupId>43742692632</duplicateGroupId>\n\t\t\t<media/>\n\t\t\t<publishingPlatform>\n\t\t\t\t<itemId>61G7-6YT1-DYTM-917R-00000-00</itemId>\n\t\t\t\t<originalItemId/>\n\t\t\t\t<statusId/>\n\t\t\t\t<itemType/>\n\t\t\t\t<inReplyToUserId/>\n\t\t\t\t<inReplyToStatusId/>\n\t\t\t\t<userMentions/>\n\t\t\t\t<totalViews/>\n\t\t\t\t<shareCount/>\n\t\t\t\t<likeCount/>\n\t\t\t</publishingPlatform>\n\t\t\t<adultLanguage>false</adultLanguage>\n\t\t\t<topics>\n\t\t\t\t<topic>\n\t\t\t\t\t<name>Philippines news</name>\n\t\t\t\t\t<group>Regional</group>\n\t\t\t\t</topic>\n\t\t\t</topics>\n\t\t\t<companies>\n\t\t\t\t<company>\n\t\t\t\t\t<name>Rebel Group Inc</name>\n\t\t\t\t\t<symbol>REBL</symbol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<exchange>PINX</exchange>\n\t\t\t\t\t<isin>US75617J1051</isin>\n\t\t\t\t\t<titleCount>0</titleCount>\n\t\t\t\t\t<contentCount>1</contentCount>\n\t\t\t\t\t<primary>true</primary>\n\t\t\t\t</company>\n\t\t\t</companies>\n\t\t\t<print>\n\t\t\t\t<supplement/>\n\t\t\t\t<publicationEdition>Manila Bulletin</publicationEdition>\n\t\t\t\t<regionalEdition/>\n\t\t\t\t<section/>\n\t\t\t\t<sectionFull/>\n\t\t\t\t<pageNumber/>\n\t\t\t\t<pageCount/>\n\t\t\t\t<sizeCm/>\n\t\t\t\t<sizePercentage/>\n\t\t\t\t<originLeft/>\n\t\t\t\t<originTop/>\n\t\t\t\t<width/>\n\t\t\t\t<height/>\n\t\t\t\t<byLine/>\n\t\t\t\t<photo/>\n\t\t\t</print>\n\t\t\t<author>\n\t\t\t\t<name/>\n\t\t\t\t<homeUrl/>\n\t\t\t\t<email/>\n\t\t\t\t<description/>\n\t\t\t\t<dateLastActive/>\n\t\t\t\t<publishingPlatform>\n\t\t\t\t\t<userName/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<userId/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<statusesCount/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<totalViews/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<followingCount/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<followersCount/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<kloutScore/>\n\t\t\t\t</publishingPlatform>\n\t\t\t</author>\n\t\t\t<licenses>\n\t\t\t\t<license>\n\t\t\t\t\t<name>LexisNexis Licensed</name>\n\t\t\t\t</license>\n\t\t\t</licenses>\n\t\t\t<source>\n\t\t\t\t<name>Manila Bulletin</name>\n\t\t\t\t<homeUrl>http://www.mb.com.ph</homeUrl>\n\t\t\t\t<publisher/>\n\t\t\t\t<primaryLanguage/>\n\t\t\t\t<primaryMediaType/>\n\t\t\t\t<category>National</category>\n\t\t\t\t<editorialRank>3</editorialRank>\n\t\t\t\t<industry/>\n\t\t\t\t<location>\n\t\t\t\t\t<country>Philippines</country>\n\t\t\t\t\t<countryCode>PH</countryCode>\n\t\t\t\t\t<region>Asia</region>\n\t\t\t\t\t<subregion>South-Eastern Asia</subregion>\n\t\t\t\t\t<state/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<county/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<zipArea/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<zipCode/>\n\t\t\t\t</location>\n\t\t\t\t<feed>\n\t\t\t\t\t<id>654521472</id>\n\t\t\t\t\t<name/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<mediaType>Print</mediaType>\n\t\t\t\t\t<publishingPlatform>LexisNexis Licensed</publishingPlatform>\n\t\t\t\t\t<idFromPublisher>p140610</idFromPublisher>\n\t\t\t\t\t<generator/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<description/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<imageUrl/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<copyright/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<language>Unassigned</language>\n\t\t\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t\t\t<rank>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<autoRank/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<autoRankOrder/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<inboundLinkCount>0</inboundLinkCount>\n\t\t\t\t\t</rank>\n\t\t\t\t\t<inWhiteList>false</inWhiteList>\n\t\t\t\t\t<autoTopics/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<editorialTopics/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<genre/>\n\t\t\t\t</feed>\n\t\t\t</source>\n\t\t</article>",

The pictures show the jihadists moving into the base, capturing several vehicles and various weapons. Other photos then show the fighters walking around central Bacaadweyne unopposed. \n \nThe pictures do not show any actual fighting, however, several dead Somali troops are shown inside the base. \n \nVoice of America\u2019s Somali service added that the town was later recaptured by government forces after armed citizens joined in a counter-offensive against the jihadists. \n \nCasualty figures from yesterday\u2019s fighting has varied widely. Voice of America reported that four Somali soldiers and 10 civilians involved in the counter-offensive were killed. \n \nMeanwhile, Mudug officials claimed that 12 members of Shabaab were killed. Other sources have indicated that at least 20 people were killed in total. \n \nFor its part, Shabaab said it killed 53 soldiers and militiamen. In response, Somali military officials stated that their forces killed 50 jihadists in the fighting. An additional 6 militants were reportedly captured . \n \nDespite the discrepancies in casualty numbers, it is clear that Shabaab did in fact overrun the military base and town albeit only briefly. While most of its resources are invested in southern Somalia, the al Qaeda branch has shown it remains a potent threat across much of the country. \n \nRecent String of Attacks \n \nThe raid in Bacaadweyne comes after a series of other recent Shabaab attacks across Somalia. \n \nJust before the Bacaadweyne raid yesterday, Shabaab was also responsible for an attack on the Turkish-trained Gorgor special forces unit in Lower Shabelle. That ambush occurred as Somali troops mounted an operation near Afgooye on the outskirts of Mogadishu. \n \nOn Sunday, the jihadist group was also blamed for murdering an entire family in the southern Bakool Region. Shabaab did not comment on this series of purported executions. \n \nWhile on Nov. 27, a Shabaab suicide bomber detonated himself outside an ice cream parlor in Mogadishu killing at least 7 people. \n \nIn its claim of responsibility, Shabaab said it was targeting a grouping of government officials. However, most reporting indicates the victims were civilians. \n \nOn Nov. 24, 6 Somali soldiers from the US-trained Danab special forces unit were purportedly killed in an IED in the southern Lower Shabelle Region not far from the joint Somali-US base at Baledogle . \n \nA few days earlier on Nov. 17, Shabaab conducted another suicide bombing at a restaurant in Mogadishu which killed 5 civilians. \n \nAnd finally, on Nov. 6, Shabaab claimed it killed an American soldier in suicide bombing during a failed raid on the jihadists in the coastal city of  Gandershe. \n \nThe United States has not commented on this claim, but on Nov. 26, the Central Intelligence Agency did admit one of its officers was recently killed in Somalia . It is possible that the officer was killed in the alleged Nov. 6 raid. \n \nWith these recent attacks, Shabaab has conducted at least 29 suicide bombings inside Somalia since the beginning of 2020 according to data compiled by FDD\u2019s Long War Journal . \n \nDespite some setbacks in recent years, Shabaab continues to be one of al Qaeda\u2019s most effective branches. It maintains significant control over much of southern Somalia and retains the ability to strike in\u00a0Mogadishu,\u00a0 Kenya , and against heavily fortified bases in both Somalia and Kenya. \n \nThough its fortunes have ebbed and flowed over the past decade, it has weathered numerous offensives from an array of local, regional, and international actors, including the United States. \n \nPhotos released by Shabaab reportedly from the raid in Bacaadweyne: \n       \nCaleb Weiss is a contributor to FDD's Long War Journal. \n \nAre you a dedicated reader of FDD's Long War Journal?

in exploding a bomb as a vehicle from the Russian Embassy in Kabul</title>\n\t\t\t<content>MADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\n   Several Russian diplomats were wounded on Tuesday after a bomb exploded as a vehicle from the Russian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.\n\n\n   As the Russian Foreign Ministry explained in a statement, several embassy employees have been slightly injured.\n   The spokeswoman, Maria Zajarova, noted that during a vehicle journey of the Russian diplomatic mission on a road near the Embassy compound in Kabul she detonated \"a homemade explosive device\".\n   According to preliminary reports, the target of the attack was a van by Afghan security forces moving in front of the diplomatic vehicle with soldiers inside.\n   \"We demand that Afghanistan conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of russian representation personnel in Afghanistan,\" said Zajarova.\n   In this regard, it detailed that the Russian Embassy in Kabul had put in place a number of additional measures aimed at increasing the security of diplomatic mission personnel and facilities.</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-02T10:52:06Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43695170421&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=vDSzusBW_PznqIabQilEMQ</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>172</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright

by pirates on a tanker ship in the Gulf of Guinea</title>\n\t\t\t<content>MADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\n   Four crew members of a tanker ship have been kidnapped by pirates on the Gulf of Guinea, on the west central coast of the African continent, while travelling from republic of congo towards Togo.\n\n\n   The tanker AGISILAOS, which was carrying petroleum derivatives, was attacked by pirates in the Gulf of Guinea on the night of November 29, on its way from Pointe Noire in the Republic of The Congo to Lom\u00e9, capital of Togo, as reported by the Maritime Bulletin news portal.\n   The pirates kidnapped four crew members, including citizens of the Philippines, Romania and Russia, and escaped, while the rest of the crew is safe and the ship was finally able to reach Lom\u00e9.\n   Hours before the attack, maritime security company Dryad Global's news portal reported an attempted attack by strangers in the Gulf on AGISILAOS, which was five nautical miles off the coast of Ghana, in ghanaian jurisdictional waters.\n   According to the information provided by this means, the ship, which sailed under the Marshall Islands banner, attempted maneuvers to prevent the attackers from getting on board.\n   Pirate activity in the Gulf of Guinea has intensified in recent months, where attacks have been on Benin and Nigerian waters in a short time ago, focusing mainly on merchant ships, mainly oil tankers and where there are no permanently prominent military units in the area to repel attacks.</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-02T10:50:00Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43695154239&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=PNUfJKVO6OorZrJJwpv2jQ</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>234</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright

UN partners have found the deaths of 55 civilians in October throughout the Eponymous Governorate, a similar figure to November.\n   Artillery shell attacks in residential areas in the east of the city have increased, while armed clashes have taken place on surrounding fronts, increasing the death rates of civilians in the area.\n   \"Indiscriminate artillery shelling in residential areas has to stop,\" Musani has settled, while asking the parties involved in the Yemeni conflict to \"distinguish between civilians and fighters.\"\n   \"Attacks on civilians are prohibited,\" he recalled, noting that recent bombings of Taiz \"are violations of international humanitarian law.\"\n   In this regard, Musani has censored that Yemen is facing increasing levels of humanitarian needs, with increasing rates of food insecurity and malnutrition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an under-funded aid operation, so the focus should be on \"saving lives.\"\n   It has therefore urged all parties to the conflict to do their best to facilitate the humanitarian response and to commit themselves to stopping the violence.\n   Another artillery shell attack on a village in The Governorate of Hodeida left at least five children and three women dead on Sunday, as well as three other children and three women injured, the United Nations reported.\n   In this regard, UNICEF, which has raised the number of children killed in the two attacks to eleven, lamented that the \"child slaughter is appalling.\" The UN agency, which has detailed that a one-month-old baby is among the deceased, has warned that \"fact-checking is still ongoing, so the actual number of victims could be higher.\"\n   \"Children must be protected at all times,\" he said, urging all parties to the conflict to \"respect\" children and \"keep them out of danger.\"\n   Forces loyal to the Yemeni government, led by Abdo Rabbu Mansur Hadi and supported by Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-backed Huthi rebels have been fighting since late 2014, in a war now considered a power conflict between the region's two main rival powers.\n   The conflict has led to what is the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.

UN partners have found the deaths of 55 civilians in October throughout the Eponymous Governorate, a similar figure to November.<br/>   Artillery shell attacks in residential areas in the east of the city have increased, while armed clashes have taken place on surrounding fronts, increasing the death rates of civilians in the area.<br/>   \"Indiscriminate artillery shelling in residential areas has to stop,\" Musani has settled, while asking the parties involved in the Yemeni conflict to \"distinguish between civilians and fighters.\"<br/>   \"Attacks on civilians are prohibited,\" he recalled, noting that recent bombings of Taiz \"are violations of international humanitarian law.\"<br/>   In this regard, Musani has censored that Yemen is facing increasing levels of humanitarian needs, with increasing rates of food insecurity and malnutrition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an under-funded aid operation, so the focus should be on \"saving lives.\"<br/>   It has therefore urged all parties to the conflict to do their best to facilitate the humanitarian response and to commit themselves to stopping the violence.<br/>   Another artillery shell attack on a village in The Governorate of Hodeida left at least five children and three women dead on Sunday, as well as three other children and three women injured, the United Nations reported.<br/>   In this regard, UNICEF, which has raised the number of children killed in the two attacks to eleven, lamented that the \"child slaughter is appalling.\" The UN agency, which has detailed that a one-month-old baby is among the deceased, has warned that \"fact-checking is still ongoing, so the actual number of victims could be higher.\"<br/>   \"Children must be protected at all times,\" he said, urging all parties to the conflict to \"respect\" children and \"keep them out of danger.\"<br/>   Forces loyal to the Yemeni government, led by Abdo Rabbu Mansur Hadi and supported by Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-backed Huthi rebels have been fighting since late 2014, in a war now considered a power conflict between the region's two main rival powers.<br/>   The conflict has led to what is the world's biggest humanitarian crisis. Today, nearly 80 percent of the population, some 24 million people, need assistance in the country, where there are more than 20 million in food insecurity.<br/></p></div>\n\n\n</div></body></html>",

Reuters\n\nNato faces \"hard decisions\" in 2021 over ending its two-decade presence in Afghanistan, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\nAlmost 2,000 US troops were withdrawn from the country last month.\n\nFewer than 12,000 soldiers from Nato countries remain in Afghanistan, mainly as trainers and advisers, but fears are rising that an unco-ordinated withdrawal could jeopardise stability.\n\nPeace talks between the Taliban, which has demanded the withdrawal of Nato forces, and the Afghan government remain delicately poised, while violence persists across the country.\n\n\"As we continue to assess the situation in Afghanistan, it is clear that we will face a turning point early next year,\" Mr Stoltenberg said after an online meeting of Nato foreign ministers.\n\n\"If we stay, we risk continued fighting and an even longer-term engagement.\n\n\"If we leave, we risk Afghanistan once again becoming a safe haven for international terrorists and the loss of the gains made with such sacrifice.\n\n\"So there is a price for staying longer but there is also a price for leaving too soon.\n\n\"We will have to take some hard decisions when Nato defence ministers meet next February.\n\n\"But whatever we decide, we must do it in a co-ordinated and orderly way.\"\n\nThere has been a surge in violence in Afghanistan this year with often unrelenting Taliban attacks on the country's beleaguered security forces and the added threat of an ISIS presence.\n\nThe already disastrous humanitarian situation has been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAbout $12 billion in aid was pledged over the next four years at a conference last month, but much of it is tied to the progress of the peace talks.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas was also cautious about withdrawing too soon and said clear conditions must be set if there were to be further troop reductions.\n\n\"To safeguard what we have reached so far, we must not take any rash actions,\" Mr Maas said.\n\n\"This is why we call on the alliance to have a very close look at how far the conditions for a further withdrawal have been met to avoid sending a wrong message regarding the peace process.\"\n\nUpdated: December 2, 2020 12:52 AM\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/42/160686770766.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/92/160686770780.JPG\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/11/160686770796.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/10/160686770811.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/70/160686770826.JPG\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/88/160686770842.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/98/160686770857.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/36/160686770872.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/72/160686770894.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/12/160686770909.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/1/160686770924.JPG\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/99/160686770940.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/73/160686770946.JPG\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/81/160686770963.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/54/160686770980.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/90/160686771000.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/20/160686771014.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/42/160686771029.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/83/160686771036.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/15/160686771053.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/73/160686771064.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/91/160686771069.jpg\n\n\n\n\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/62/160686771135.jpg\n\nNato soldiers, such as these pictured in Torkham area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan in 2014, help train and advise Afghan forces.

According to Yoga Priyautama, the chief of police in Sigi, a joint team has spread out and conducted searches in a number of areas that are suspected to be the killers\u2019 escape routes. \n\nFollowing the attack,\u00a0ICC followed up with local Christians to receive more information about the case. \n\nSurvivors said that on the day of the murders, a Christian woman, Nei, was having breakfast with her husband, Yasa, when she saw approximately 10 unknown people visiting someone named Naka, who was at a nearby house in Tokelemo, Lembantongoa Village. \n Free CP Newsletters  \nJoin over 250,000 others to get the top stories curated daily, plus special offers! \n   Free CP Newsletters  \nJoin over 250,000 others to get the top stories curated daily, plus special offers! \n  \nShortly thereafter, the terrorists entered Nei and Yasa\u2019s home. They tied Yasa to a chair and then decapitated him with a machete and stabbed him in the back. His wife managed to escape after witnessing the killing, according to South China Morning Post . Some witnesses fled after seeing one of the MIT members near Yasa\u2019s house. \n\nNaka and his son, Pedi, along with their house, were set on fire, while a fellow church member named Pinu was stabbed to death. In a previous report, ICC said they saw a video showing a charred victim being pulled from a pile of ruins, with smoke still rising in the background. \n\n\u201cThe fowler position of the body suggests the agony and pain endured by the victim before death.\u201d \n\nYasa\u2019s son, Ulin, survived the attack and reported it to the police. The head of Lembantongoa village, Deki Basalulu, told Benar News that approximately 750 people fled their homes after the attack and took shelter at a safe location a few miles away. \n\nThe\u00a0 Salvation Army International confirmed \u00a0the attack on Saturday, saying that its building along with six homes of members were burned. \n\nLocal Christians told ICC that MIT militants frequently interacted with the community, often asking for food from the church and the church fed them. The terrorists reportedly suspected that the community had informed police of their presence and therefore retaliated. \n\nHowever, Indonesian authorities have claimed that the attack was not religiously motivated and \u201cmerely an effort by the MIT to fulfill their goals and show their existence.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis killing was not targeted at Christians,\u201d Brigadier-General Farid Makhruf, commander of a military force that covered Central Sulawesi,\u00a0claimed. \u201cThe victims were very unfortunate. The militants were likely to be looking for food and stumbled upon the villagers, and because it is very remote, it made them easy targets.\u201d \n\nIn a statement, Gina Goh, ICC\u2019s regional manager for Southeast Asia, said that while ICC \u201cappreciates the authorities for their swift actions to hunt down the perpetrators through the joint operation,\u201d it is \u201cdisappointing to hear the official rhetoric that this attack was not motivated by religion and no church was burned down.\u201d \n\n\u201cMinority Christians in Indonesia have long suffered from discrimination and persecution and the Indonesian government should not cover the truth in the name of maintaining religious harmony,\u201d she said. \n\nOver 80% of the population in Papua identifies as Christian, contrasting the predominantly Muslim Indonesia. Open Doors USA ranks Indonesia among the 50 countries where it is most difficult to be a Christian. \n Free CP Newsletters  \nJoin over 250,000 others to get the top stories curated daily, plus

Several percuted shell casings were found.\nL\u00f3pez Ruiz, 61, was a retired teacher; he was appointed interim mayor of Chamula in June 1993, following the resignation of Lorenzo P\u00e9rez Jolote, also a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).\nPastor Esdras Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez, leader of the evangelical church Alas de Aguila, said that during his rule the expulsions of Chamula indians who had converted to Protestantism intensified.\nAccording to various estimates, more than 30 thousand inhabitants of Chamula were expelled since the 1960s by traditionalist priist chieftains, on the grounds that they had become evangelical or related to the diocese of San Cristobal, then headed by Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garc\u00eda.\nHe amassed 57 complaints; never investigated it\nAlonso Gonz\u00e1lez recalled that in a year L\u00f3pez Ruiz amassed 57 previous inquiries against him for offences related to expulsions (illegal deprivation of liberty, stripping, damage and others) and none were recorded by public prosecutors on the orders of the state government.\nIn interview, he added that they even had a recommendation from the National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH) blown up. It was a story of impunity.\"\nHe stated that on 5 July 1994, six months after the Zapatista armed uprising, L\u00f3pez Ruiz was kidnapped by an armed evangelical group.

Several percuted shell casings were found.<br/>L\u00f3pez Ruiz, 61, was a retired teacher; he was appointed interim mayor of Chamula in June 1993, following the resignation of Lorenzo P\u00e9rez Jolote, also a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).<br/>Pastor Esdras Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez, leader of the evangelical church Alas de Aguila, said that during his rule the expulsions of Chamula indians who had converted to Protestantism intensified.<br/>According to various estimates, more than 30 thousand inhabitants of Chamula were expelled since the 1960s by traditionalist priist chieftains, on the grounds that they had become evangelical or related to the diocese of San Cristobal, then headed by Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garc\u00eda.<br/>He amassed 57 complaints; never investigated it<br/>Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez recalled that in a year L\u00f3pez Ruiz amassed 57 previous inquiries against him for offences related to expulsions (illegal deprivation of liberty, stripping, damage and others) and none were recorded by public prosecutors on the orders of the state government.<br/>In interview, he added that they even had a recommendation from the National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH) blown up. It was a story of impunity.\"<br/>He stated that on 5 July 1994, six months after the Zapatista armed uprising, L\u00f3pez Ruiz was kidnapped by an armed evangelical group. For half a year 587 Chamula Protestants had been planted in the then Directorate of Indigenous Affairs, based in this city.

without television or radio in France</title>\n\t\t\t<content>Some 3.5 million people in southeastern France were left without television or radio on Tuesday after an arson attack the night before on a platform of the T\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion de France (TDF) near Marseille.\n\n\n\"There is no doubt that the fire was arson,\" TDF Sud-Est regional director Patrice Bargas told AFP, evoking \"traces of break-ins.\"\nThe fire broke out Monday night in the issuing room and spread through cables, local firefighters said, citing the possibility of an \"intrusion\" and a \"malicious act.\" Meanwhile, an investigation has been opened by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Aix-en-Provence.\nAfter the fire, the broadcast of 25 channels of TDT (Digital Terrestrial Television) of a total of 30, and 19 FM radio stations, was interrupted in a large neighborhood of the southeast of the territory, TDF said.\nChannels TF1, LCP public-senate, TFX, Energie 12 and TMC continued.\nThe platform, whose fa\u00e7ade featured black traces of smoke and flames, according to photographic records, also houses mobile phone relay antennas.\nCustomers of bouygues t\u00e9l\u00e9com, orange, free and sfr operators were affected, albeit to a lesser extent.\nThe television and radio antenna alone covers 2.6 million inhabitants and feeds other transmitters in the region, affecting an even larger population.\n\"This is one of our most important sites, a nerve center with a large coverage area due to its high position,\" patrice bargas said.\nInstalled in 1954 on top of a mountain surrounded by hiking trails, at an altitude of 600 meters, the platform is the most important in the southeast and the second largest in France.\nIn recent months, several 5G relay antennas have been burned in France, actions often carried out by ultra-leftist activists or opponents of 5G.</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-02T10:52:03Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43695169871&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=BrrHaxreEisVMt3BiXvCYw</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>288</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright

Eufemia Cullamat, Esperon said Jevilyn 'lost her life for a forsaken cause.'\n\nEsperon said Jevilyn, who was killed in Surigao del Sur in a clash between New People's Army (NPA) and the military, was meted the death sentence as soon as she joined NPA, which Esperon said had been condoned by her family.\n\n'Jevilyn was not a martyr,' said Esperon, armed forces chief of staff of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.\n\n'She was deceived into sacrificing her life for a cause lacking any noble purpose,' he said in a statement.\n\nEsperon said Jevilyn's death has been 'politicized' and 'romanticized.'\n\nJevilyn, whom soldiers tagged as NPA medic, was a 'victim of a manipulative organization that has taken advantage of her from the moment she was radicalized until her recruitment into the armed struggle,' Esperon said.\n\nRepresentative Cullamat earlier hailed her daughter as hero of the lumad, who joined NPA because of continuing military abuse of lumad communities\n\nEsperon said the lawmaker showed she lacked remorse over the death of her daughter in the company of guerrillas.\n\n'It pains me that even in her daughter's death, Representative Cullamat cannot show remorse and has gone so far as extolling the false advocacy and political agenda of the armed revolution,' Esperon said.\n\nHe said other relatives of Jevilyn were also members of NPA and involved in criminal cases, like kidnapping and murder.\n\n'We see the deep-rooted radicalization of the extended Cullamat family and the exploitation of the indigenous peoples' community,' Esperon said.\n\nHe called on NPA backers to ponder on their support for the armed revolution which, he said, 'has claimed the lives of thousands of Filipinos.'</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-03T10:11:49Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43703489330&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=7e0yBQW9mNF68qduPNc7Jg</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>325</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright

One, Raze Houses In Delta Community</title>\n\t\t\t<content>Rampaging suspected cultists have killed one person, injured scores and razed houses in Oteri community, Ughelli, Delta State.\n\nThe community it was learnt on Tuesday, is licking its wounds after the rampaging cultists left in their wake a tale of blood, sorrow and tears with no fewer than four buildings burnt.\n\nThe incident, it was gathered, occurred on Sunday, November 29, 2020, at about 6:50 pm.\n\nIt was gathered that trouble started when one Oghenero Oke, also known as Last Card, was shot and killed by a group of gunmen believed to be members of Aye confraternity.\n\nThe victim, who is a member of Mafia confraternity and also an indigene of the community, was said to have had an altercation with one Elohor over the relationship he had with Elohor's elder sister which had turned sour.\n\nAlthough reasons for the carnage were still sketchy, the house and shop belonging to the parents of Elohor were one of the houses reportedly burnt down.\n\nIt will be recalled that members of the Aye confraternity have been in a sustained battle with the Aro Baggers confraternity.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts were said to be ongoing by the leadership of the community to fish out the perpetrators who are currently at large.\n\nThe corpse of the deceased has been reportedly deposited at the Central Hospital mortuary in Ughelli, while those with severe injuries are said to be receiving treatment at one Ufor Hospital.\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, the fear of possible reprisals has heightened in the community as security operatives patrol the community.\n\nConfirming the incident, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Delta Police Command, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), confirmed the incident but added that no house was burnt.\n\nOteri community is the country home of the immediate past secretary to the Delta State Government (SSG), Festus Ovie Agas.</content>\n\t\t\t<tags/>\n\t\t\t<publishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</publishedDate>\n\t\t\t<harvestDate>2020-12-03T10:12:02Z</harvestDate>\n\t\t\t<updateDate/>\n\t\t\t<estimatedPublishedDate>2020-12-01T12:00:00Z</estimatedPublishedDate>\n\t\t\t<embargoDate/>\n\t\t\t<licenseEndDate/>\n\t\t\t<url>http://ct.moreover.com/?a=43703491314&amp;p=w0&amp;v=1&amp;x=iZR9YGBXcagFRTy2VJAH0g</url>\n\t\t\t<commentsUrl/>\n\t\t\t<outboundUrls/>\n\t\t\t<wordCount>310</wordCount>\n\t\t\t<dataFormat>text</dataFormat>\n\t\t\t<copyright>Copyright

North local government area of Delta state\n\nIt was learnt that the trouble started when one Oghenero Oke with nickname Last Card was shot dead by suspected gunmen believed to be members of AYE Confraternity led by the leader of the group.\n\nThe late One whom they said was a member of Mafia Confraternity until his death had had an issue with one of the leaders of the Aye Confraternity following a relationship late Oke was into with the leader's elder sister.\n\nIt was gathered that it was late Oke's death that led to the shooting and raising down of the building and shop belonging to the parents of one of the leaders of the Aye confraternity by irate youths from the community.\n\nIt would be recalled that members of the Aye confraternity have been in a running battle with the Aro baggers confraternity about 3 weeks ago and this incident may further cause crisis between the Aye and Mafia confraternities.\n\nA source who pleaded anonymity said efforts are ongoing by the leadership of the Community to fish out the perpetrators who are currently at large, while the corpse of the deceased has been deposited at the Central Hospital mortuary in Ughelli.\n\nSecurity personnel have been drafted to the area and every part of Ughelli to calm the tension and fear of possible reprisal in the community since weekends till date.\n\nA Police source in A Division Police station confirmed the incident and said they are on top of the

Palestinians In West Bank</title>\n\t\t\t<content>Israeli soldiers abducted, on Tuesday at dawn, eleven Palestinians from their homes in several parts of the occupied West Bank, after the soldiers invaded many communities, searched and ransacked homes, the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society (PPS) has reported. \n \nThe PPS said the soldiers abducted Moath Ka\u2019bi, and Nidal Khalaf al-Haj Mohammad, from their homes, and added that Nidal is the brother of Monther, a political prisoner who was sentenced by Israel to thirty years in prison. \n \nIn occupied Jerusalem, the soldiers abducted a former political prisoner and a student at Birzeit University, identified as Bakr Oweiss, in addition to Montaser Barbar, the son of Majd Barbar, who is also a political prisoner serving a 20-year sentence, in addition to Faisal Luay, from the al-\u2018Isawiya town. \n \nThe soldiers also abducted Ayman Abu Eid, Hashem Hmeidan, Ziad Taha, Jouda Houshiyya and Sharif Khdour, from the towns of Biddu and Qotna, near Jerusalem. \n \nIn Salfit, in central West Bank, the soldiers abducted Rawdi Ma\u2019zouz Yassin, from his home. \n \nIn related news, the soldiers invaded the al-Khader
